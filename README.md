# CryptiHub - Secure End-to-End Encrypted Chat System

A secure chat application featuring room-based end-to-end encryption, designed to protect your communications from eavesdropping.

## Key Features:

- üîí **End-to-End Encryption** using Fernet (AES-256)
- üõ°Ô∏è **Room-Based Authentication** with unique keys
- üåê **Real-Time Broadcasting** to multiple clients
- üßµ **Thread-Safe** socket handling
- üîë **PBKDF2 Key Derivation** (1.2M iterations)

## Installation:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pevinkumar10/CryptiHub.git
cd CryptiHub
```
### Install dependencies:
- In windows
   ```bash
      pip3 install -r requirements.txt
   ```
- In Linux
   ```bash
      apt-get install python3-tk
   ```

## Configuring CryptiHub:
- Configuring Server:
    - This is the default HOST and PORT configuration. If you need to change it , then modify it server/modules/core.py
        ```markdown
        HOST = ''
        PORT = 1234

        ```
- Configuring Client:
    - This is the default HOST and PORT configuration. If you need to change it , then modify it client/client.py
        ```markdown
        HOST = ''
        PORT = 1234

        ```

## Usage:

### Starting the Server:
```bash
python3 server/server.py
```

### Connecting Clients:
```bash

python3 clients/client.py

```

## Security Architecture:

1. **Key Derivation**  
   Uses PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 with:
   - 1,200,000 iterations
   - 16-byte random salt per message
   - 32-byte derived keys

2. **Encryption**  
   - AES-256 in GCM mode via Fernet
   - Message-level salts prevent replay attacks

3. **Authentication**  
   - Clients must prove room ID to enter the chat
   - Username collision prevention

## Limitations:

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: This implementation uses symmetric encryption with a shared room key. For true E2EE where the server cannot decrypt messages, consider:

1. Implementing Diffie-Hellman key exchange
2. Adding ephemeral session keys
3. Client-side key storage
